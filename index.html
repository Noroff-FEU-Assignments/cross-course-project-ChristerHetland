    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">[The site should be HTTPS, which means that the communication between the server and the client is encrypted using either TLS or SSL.
      The client's users should have different passwords and usernames, and they should make them strong and secure. And maybe change password every now and then.
      I would advise the client to include everyone in the security practices, so that everyone in the company knows what to do, and what to look after if there is a web attack.
      Keeping track of the most popular threats at any time is also a good advice. In that way the client knows what to protect and can address the most common vulnerabilities first. They can keep track of this by using the OWASP list]</p>
